## Security concerns regarding usage of NRCHKB

NRCHKB is a node (plugin/library) for node-red. NRCHKB allow user to simulate HomeKit devices.

### node-red

To use node-red safely you should secure it properly with encryption and password protection
- [here is how in official node-red docs](https://nodered.org/docs/security).

### Invalid Setup Codes

The following Setup Codes must not be used due to their trivial, insecure nature. In future release (possibly 1.X.Y)
they will be forbidden programmatically.

- 000-00-000
- 111-11-111
- 222-22-222
- 333-33-333
- 444-44-444
- 555-55-555
- 666-66-666
- 777-77-777
- 888-88-888
- 999-99-999
- 123-45-678
- 876-54-321

Since 1.3 random Setup Code will be generated for new Bridge nodes (instead of default 111-11-111)
